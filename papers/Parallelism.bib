  abstract = {\emph{Defunctionalization} is a program transformation
                 that eliminates functions as first-class values. We
                 show that defunctionalization can be viewed as a
                 \emph{type-preserving} transformation of an extension
                 of \f with \emph{guarded algebraic data types} into
                 itself. We also suggest that defunctionalization is an
                 instance of \emph{concretization}, a more general
                 technique that allows eliminating constructs other than
                 functions. We illustrate this point by presenting two
                 new type-preserving transformations that can be viewed
                 as instances of concretization. One eliminates
                 Rémy-style polymorphic records; the other eliminates
                 the dictionary records introduced by the standard
                 compilation scheme for Haskell's type classes.}
