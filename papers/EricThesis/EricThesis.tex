%% The following makes chapters and sections, but not subsections,
%% appear in the TOC (table of contents). Increase to 2 or 3 to
%% make subsections or subsubsections appear, respectively. It seems
%% to be usual to use the "1" setting, however.
\setcounter{tocdepth}{1}

%% Sectional units up to subsubsections are numbered. To number
%% subsections, but not subsubsections, decrease this counter to 2.
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}

%% Page layout (customized to letter paper and NYU requirements):
\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{.6in}
\setlength{\textwidth}{5.8in}
\setlength{\topmargin}{.1in}
\setlength{\headheight}{0in}
\setlength{\headsep}{0in}
\setlength{\textheight}{8.3in}
\setlength{\footskip}{.5in}

%% Use the following commands, if desired, during production.
%% Comment them out for final version.
%\usepackage{layout} % defines the \layout command, see below
%\setlength{\hoffset}{-.75in} % creates a large right margin for notes and \showlabels

%% Controls spacing between lines (\doublespacing, \onehalfspacing, etc.):
\usepackage{setspace}

%% Use the line below for official NYU version, which requires
%% double line spacing. For all other uses, this is unnecessary,
%% so the line can be commented out.
\doublespacing % requires package setspace, invoked above

%% Each of the following lines defines the \com command, which produces
%% a comment (notes for yourself, for instance) in the output file.
%% Example:    \com{this will appear as a comment in the output}
%% Choose (uncomment) only one of the three forms:
%\newcommand{\com}[1]{[/// {#1} ///]}       % between [/// and ///].
\newcommand{\com}[1]{\marginpar{\tiny #1}} % as (tiny) margin notes
%\newcommand{\com}[1]{}                     % suppress all comments.

%% This inputs your auxiliary file with \usepackage's and \newcommand's:
%% It is assumed that that file is called "definitions.tex".
\input{definitions}

%% Cross-referencing utilities. Use one or the other--whichever you prefer--
%% but comment out both lines for final version.
%\usepackage{showlabels}
%\usepackage{showkeys}
